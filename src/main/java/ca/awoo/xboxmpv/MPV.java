     * Create a new mpv instance and an associated client API handle to control
     * the mpv instance. This instance is in a pre-initialized state,
     * and needs to be initialized to be actually used with most other API
     * functions.
     *
     * Some API functions will return MPV_ERROR_UNINITIALIZED in the uninitialized
     * state. You can call mpv_set_property() (or mpv_set_property_string() and
     * other variants, and before mpv 0.21.0 mpv_set_option() etc.) to set initial
     * options. After this, call mpv_initialize() to start the player, and then use
     * e.g. mpv_command() to start playback of a file.
     *
     * The point of separating handle creation and actual initialization is that
     * you can configure things which can't be changed during runtime.
     *
     * Unlike the command line player, this will have initial settings suitable
     * for embedding in applications. The following settings are different:
     * - stdin/stdout/stderr and the terminal will never be accessed. This is
     *   equivalent to setting the --no-terminal option.
     *   (Technically, this also suppresses C signal handling.)
     * - No config files will be loaded. This is roughly equivalent to using
     *   --config=no. Since libmpv 1.15, you can actually re-enable this option,
     *   which will make libmpv load config files during mpv_initialize(). If you
     *   do this, you are strongly encouraged to set the "config-dir" option too.
     *   (Otherwise it will load the mpv command line player's config.)
     *   For example:
     *      mpv_set_option_string(mpv, "config-dir", "/my/path"); // set config root
     *      mpv_set_option_string(mpv, "config", "yes"); // enable config loading
     *      (call mpv_initialize() _after_ this)
     * - Idle mode is enabled, which means the playback core will enter idle mode
     *   if there are no more files to play on the internal playlist, instead of
     *   exiting. This is equivalent to the --idle option.
     * - Disable parts of input handling.
     * - Most of the different settings can be viewed with the command line player
     *   by running "mpv --show-profile=libmpv".
     *
     * All this assumes that API users want a mpv instance that is strictly
     * isolated from the command line player's configuration, user settings, and
     * so on. You can re-enable disabled features by setting the appropriate
     * options.
     *
     * The mpv command line parser is not available through this API, but you can
     * set individual options with mpv_set_property(). Files for playback must be
     * loaded with mpv_command() or others.
     *
     * Note that you should avoid doing concurrent accesses on the uninitialized
     * client handle. (Whether concurrent access is definitely allowed or not has
     * yet to be decided.)
     *
     * @return a new mpv client API handle. Returns NULL on error. Currently, this
